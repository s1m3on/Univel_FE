<!-- Create a new HTML file that has a 'div' with 
    a class of "intro" inside the HTML file, the 
    'div' content is Hello Everyone, I am new here.
    - Now, create a javascript file and connect it to 
    your HTML Page, inside the javascript file, perform 
    the following:-

  - Create a new paragraph element using the methods we 
    just learned.
  - Give the new paragraph element a textContent of "My 
    Name is <your name>"
  - Give the paragraph a class of "name"
  - Append the paragraph element to the 'div' in the HTML 
    Page.
  - Create an array containing a list of your favorite 
    books. The length of the array should be 10.
  - Loop through the array then display each book on our 
    webpage just like we did in class. -->
